APIs are a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide a way for one software program to request and exchange data with another, facilitating the integration of services and data from various sources. APIs are used to access services, data, or functionality provided by web servers, databases, and other applications.

## JSON Traversals

JSON traversals refer to the process of navigating and extracting data from JSON structures. This typically involves accessing specific keys, values, or elements within a JSON object or array. Traversing JSON data is a fundamental task in working with APIs because API responses are often provided in JSON format. Python provides libraries like json for parsing and manipulating JSON data, making it easy to extract and use data from JSON responses.
